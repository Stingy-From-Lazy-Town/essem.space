by [@TheEssem](https://twitter.com/TheEssem)

This page explains some info about download bots, why they are awful, and shows some alternative methods for downloading videos.

## What are they?
As the name suggests, they are Twitter bots that allow a user to download videos that another user has posted on the site. They are very common nowadays to the point where it's practically impossible to see a popular video on the site without someone tagging a bot in the replies. Some notable examples of these bots include @this_vid, @DownloaderBot, and @GetVideoBot.

## Why are they bad?

Here are some of the many disadvantages of them:
+ They spam replies due to people tagging them constantly
+ They're subject to Twitter API ratelimits because every request results in a reply
+ They're slow because they have to make many web requests to get the link
+ They require you to mention them under every video, which serves as an indicator to everyone that you are, in fact, downloading a video
+ Many bots (e.g. this_vid, GetVideoBot) have started to link to their own websites, which adds an extra step to the downloading process
+ They don't work with some types of videos, most notably ad cards
+ Some bots have started to abuse the API (e.g. twit_dl and DownloaderBot) to create anti-user mechanisms that stop creators from blocking the bots

## What other methods are there for downloading videos?
Here are a few tools for downloading videos for Twitter:
+ [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl) (Cross-platform, command-line based, highly recommended)
+ [Ripsave](https://ripsave.com) (Web, not always stable)
+ [TWDown](https://twdown.net/) (Web, slightly more stable than Ripsave)
+ [Twitter Video Downloader Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/41ed3432ea1e4bc48e881ad608bb355f) (iOS, requires the Shortcuts app)
